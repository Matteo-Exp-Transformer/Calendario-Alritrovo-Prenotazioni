# Git Worktree Quick Reference

## For Claude Agents

### Before You Start
```bash
cd c:\Users\matte.MIO\Documents\GitHub\Calendarbackup
./scripts/manage-worktrees.sh list
```

### Create Your Worktree
```bash
# Replace "agent1" with your agent name
./scripts/manage-worktrees.sh create agent1
cd .worktrees/agent1
```

### Work Independently
```bash
# You're now in your own workspace!
# Make changes, commit, test - without affecting others
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
```

### When Done
```bash
cd ../..
./scripts/manage-worktrees.sh remove agent1
```

## For Humans

```bash
# List all active worktrees
./scripts/manage-worktrees.sh list

# Create worktrees for 2 agents
./scripts/manage-worktrees.sh create agent1
./scripts/manage-worktrees.sh create agent2

# Check for conflicts
./scripts/manage-worktrees.sh check

# Clean up when done

## Why Use Worktrees?

- No git checkout conflicts
- Each agent has independent workspace
- Work in parallel without interference
- Easy cleanup when done
